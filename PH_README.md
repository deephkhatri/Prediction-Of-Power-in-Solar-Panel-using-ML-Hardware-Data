# Prediction-Of-Power-in-Solar-Panel-using-ML-Hardware-Data

## Description

This project leverages machine learning models to predict **DC_Power** generated by a solar panel, using data collected from a **hardware circuit** involving a **solar panel** and **Arduino Mega**. The dataset includes parameters such as:

- **DC_Voltage**
- **DC_Current**
- **DC_Power**
- **IR Sensor**
- **Ambient Temperature**
- **Module Temperature**

Various machine learning models are applied to this dataset to make accurate power predictions, with a **user input interface** allowing users to input parameters and predict **DC_Power** values in real-time. The user can select from different models to obtain predictions.

## Features

- **Multiple ML models** to predict DC power from solar panels using hardware data.
- **User input interface** to allow real-time predictions.
- Predictions based on hardware data from a solar panel and Arduino system.
- Comparison of model performance based on prediction accuracy.
